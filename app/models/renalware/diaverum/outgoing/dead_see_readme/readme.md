The files in this folder where from an initial approach sending XML to Diaverum
before it transpired they wanted raw HL7 - anything else sent would not make it
to iRIMS at the clinic but just be stored in Sweden and probably not used.

If it is decided afterall to send patient demographics etc to Diaverum
some of these files could be useful.
